## Commit and push your Git to Gitbash 
 
  - Open up git bash inside the folder you want to push 
  - git init
  - git checkout -b branchname (The remote branch name for gitbash)
  - git add . 
  - git commit -m 'init'
  - git remote add subname email 
  - git branch -M branchname (The branch you want it to save on github)
  - git push -u subname branchname (The branch you want it to save on github)
  - And my phase is "sean" 
## Clear out the git GUI branches and remotes every once and while 
## Make sure you have ssh set up
